A passphrase generator with some entropy checks.
In both cases, running a safe entropy generator is recommended if you're outputing multiple passphrases.
haveged is a good option <http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/>

Case 1:
create_wordlist.sh: actually zsh script to generate a word list and output some stats.
gen_passphrase.py: python script sorting the list, checking the list, filtering the list, and outputing a passphrase

Case 2 (faster):
create_wordlist2.sh: bash script generating and filtering the list.
shuffle: just calls shuf correctly to create a passphrase
